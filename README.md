Assignment #2 - Programming with predicates Discrete Mathematics
I think the assigment descriptions has been very short and vague. So i made the student calendar which has relations and rules to find out what classes students go to, what dates and rooms it is. Hope it is adequate, if not i am more than willing to give it another go with a more descriptive assigment :).


Meaningfull questions to program:
 - hasclass(daniel, 27/9, X, Y).   This gives daniels class and what location he has on the 27/9.
 - hasclass(emmely, X, Y, T).   This gives all classes with date and location that emmely has in the calender (all the dates i've put in)
 - hasclass(kristian, X, Y, lsd).   This gives the location and what date kristian has to go to large system development
